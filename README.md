## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML
- CSS Flexbox
- Media queries
- SCSS
- SCSS mixins
- CSS/SCSS variables
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued Development

I would like to continue using the details and summary elements and become more familiar with them; they're quite handy, but I don't think I've ever used them up until now.

### Useful Resources
